# The Unlit Beacon — balance notes (BAL1 retune, 2026-08-24)

Operator: Opus 5. Targets: `DIFFICULTY_TARGETS.md` (frozen). Engine: FROZEN for
the whole pass (the Sealed Deep lesson) — every measurement and the
certification ran on identical gameplay code.
Artifact: `balance_runs/unlitbeacon_bal1_PASS.json` (150×25 × 48 cells).

## Result

| | baseline (this pass) | after |
|---|---|---|
| failing cells | 28 | 9 |
| — TOO EASY | 24 | 5 |
| — TOO HARD / WALLS | 4 | 4 |
| clean encounters (all 4 tiers) | 2 | **6** (e1 e2 e3 e5 e10 e12) |

The audit's "soft throughout" read was correct: 24 of the 28 were plain scale
raises with near-zero walls. The four structural cells got structural fixes.

## Structural work

- **e3 ("hold both bridgeheads") was a COMP FILTER, not a difficulty** —
  nightmare measured melee 2% / ranged 0% / balanced 100%, and no start
  distance balanced the three (moving everyone together only traded which
  archetype was excluded). Cause: the win needs two units STANDING on contested
  forward tiles while two killers hold them in range; a fragile party has
  nothing that survives there. Fix: the archer+breaker moved one column back
  (x=6 → x=7) — the pikemen STAY on the marks. Spread collapsed 98/100 → 45/2.
  Moving the crossings closer together was tried first and made it WORSE
  (ranged 40% → 2%): marks nearer the centre sit nearer the backline.
  Full ladder now certifies: 0.50 / 0.65 / 0.75 / 0.85 (from 0.60/0.72/0.90/1.20).
- **e11 (the Adjutant duel) rebuilt per D5+** — wisps 34 → 20 HP (off the
  one-shot boundary that made the cell a coin flip), the Adjutant's difficulty
  moved from the HUNT into the DUEL (movement 5 → 4, HP 78 → 100). Nightmare
  certifies for the first time (1.85).
- **e6 ("cross the Frozen Mere") is hpScale-INERT** — you win by arriving.
  This produced the engine addition below. Also fixed: its "Dry Boots" goal
  (cross by round 6) was identical to the round-6 loss clock — awarded on
  every win, a goal that could not be failed. Now round 4.

## ⚙ Engine addition: difficulty-scoped waves (owner-approved)

`WaveSpec.difficulties?: [...]` — a wave that exists only on the listed
difficulties, filtered at encounter BUILD time (no runtime footprint
elsewhere). This is the SECOND per-tier dial the Sealed Deep post-mortem asked
for: hpScale is inert on objective fights, and every other knob was global.
First use: e6 runs +2 blizzard wisps on hard and +3 on nightmare, spawned ON
the exit tiles the win condition needs — each is a mandatory kill inside the
clock, the one way a body genuinely costs rounds in an escape. Contract test:
`tests/campaignWaveDifficulty.test.ts`.

Measured dose coefficients (for the next campaign): first exit wisp ≈ 20 pts
off the median, second ≈ 4 (diminishing — a party already at the shore kills
them in passing). Bodies BEHIND runners ≈ 0. A wisp in the centre corridor
breaks the brain's charge pathing (validation errors, whose skip-turn recovery
silently INFLATES measured difficulty — re-measure honestly after any
validation error appears).

## The 9 flagged cells

Within the stopping rule (≤5 wall pts, or the 96-vs-95 median quantization):
e4/medium (walls +2) · e6/hard (documented floor: four geometries all measure
median 76-80 vs 65, ZERO walls — a breather) · e6/nightmare (52 vs 44 on
identical content = the noise, directly demonstrated) · e7/easy, e8/easy
(quantization) · e9/medium (walls +0.3).

**⚠ e11 — SUPERSEDED by the percent-damage rebuild (2026-08-24, owner design).**
The paragraph below described the state at first certification. The owner then
proposed scaling the Adjutant's damage to the TARGET's max health, built as
`CampaignEnemy.damagePercentOfTargetMax` (0.15/strike here): the hunt now
kills a wizard hero in the same number of turns as a barbarian one, which
removed the hero-class bimodality outright. Focused re-certification
(150 builds): **hard 1.80 ✓ and nightmare 1.90 ✓ — the first time the upper
tiers have ever certified** — easy 1.30 is the 96-vs-95 quantization park
(walls +3), and medium 1.70 remains the campaign's one beyond-rule park:
walls read 17-25% across five measurements vs a 15% cap. The character of
that miss CHANGED, though: it is no longer a coin flip on hero class or the
wisp cliff — the weakest quarter of builds lose a fair damage race against a
170-effective-HP duelist, on the campaign's penultimate fight. Judged
acceptable to ship; revisit only from playtest feel. Final row:
1.30 / 1.70 / 1.80 / 1.90.

*(Original first-certification finding, kept for the record:)*
**⚠ BEYOND-RULE: e11 easy/medium/hard.** Walls 18/22/21 vs caps 10/15/25,
easy+medium still bimodal. The wisp-cliff bimodality is GONE; the residual
split is HERO CLASS: the loss is main_dead and the Adjutant hunts the main, so
fragile-hero builds brick while tanky-hero builds walk it. The squeeze
narrowed from 12-20 pts to 4-8 but no rung passes both bounds. The remaining
fixes are IDENTITY-level (soften the hunt, or de-freeze the wisps) — parked
for the owner's playtest rather than iterated blind. This is the campaign's
one real blemish.
